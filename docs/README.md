# Documentation

This folder describes the current behavior of the repository (code-first). It is intended to replace
the need to read planning specs when you need the actual product behavior.

- `docs/api.md`: HTTP API endpoints, payloads, and validation rules.
- `docs/calculation-engine.md`: Link budget math, ModCod selection, and impairment handling.
- `docs/data-model.md`: Database schema and scenario payload_snapshot structure.
- `docs/mcp-server.md`: MCP server configuration, tools, and prompts.
- `docs/frontend.md`: UI pages and client-side behavior.

Notes:
- Snapshot schema version is `1.1.0`.
- The `specs/` folder is historical and may not reflect the current implementation.
